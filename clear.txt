- Task Description
- Task Instructions
- Expected Deliverables
- Submission Requirements
- Submission Deadline (24 hours from unlock)
- Task Difficulty (Low/Medium/High)
- Skills Required

### 5.2 Task Lifecycle

#### Task Unlocking Logic
- Day 1: Task 1 becomes available
- Day 2: Task 2 becomes available (Task 1 must be submitted or skipped)
- Day 3-35: Sequential unlocking based on previous task completion
- Multiple Days: Interns can work on available tasks in any order after unlocking

#### Task State Transitions
```
Locked → Available → Submitted → (Admin Review) → Approved/Rejected
                  → Skipped (stays skipped, no further actions possible)
```

### 5.3 Task Submission

#### Submission Method
- **Required Format:** GitHub Repository Link
- **Link Validation:** System validates URL format and accessibility
- **Submission Window:** 24 hours from task unlock
- **Late Submission:** System notifies but still allows submission (may affect score)
- **Resubmission:** Allowed for rejected tasks, replaces previous submission

#### Submission Details Required
- GitHub repository URL
- Commit message (optional but recommended)
- Brief summary of what was completed (optional)
- Any additional notes or challenges (optional)

### 5.4 Task Skipping

#### Skip Mechanism
- Intern can skip any task
- Skip reduces final score by 5 percentage points per skipped task
- Maximum skipped tasks: 8 (would reduce score by 40%)
- Skipped tasks cannot be resubmitted later
- Skipped tasks unlock the next available task

#### Skip Restrictions
- Cannot skip if task deadline not reached (except during last 24 hours)
- Must provide reason for skip (optional feedback field)

### 5.5 Task Scoring
- Each task carries equal weight: 100/35 = 2.86% per task
- Bonus points: Up to 5% for exceptional performance
- Penalty points: Deducted for late submissions (1% per day)
- Skipped tasks: 0 points (5% automatic reduction from final score)
